# Using Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation Systems

Student: Matheus Oliveira

## Goal
The goal and the scope of this project is to try to use Reinforcement Learning techiniques to train a Recommendations System giving insights to a user input. The implementation of this model will be using [Recsim](https://github.com/google-research/recsim), a Google-associated framework which abstract part of the underlying configuration of the enviroment (using two sources to train an agent).

## Methods
The methods expected to accomplish this project are:
* Study implemented projects and papers using Recsim;
* Replicate enviroments and projects;
* Use the Gym Wrapper to bring Recsim to a Gym module;
* Try to train a model using tecniques like Q-Learning, DQN or DDQN;
* Compare the results against other Recommendatiom systems implementation such as ML;

## Expected Results 
The expected results are basically:
* Implementation of the framework in Gym like enviroment;
* Comparison in model results and other implementations;
